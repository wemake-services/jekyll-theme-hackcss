# Certificate verification

Servo's security infrastructure is heavily dependent on OpenSSL. I created an experiment to compare certificate verification using [WebPKI](https://github.com/briansmith/webpki) and [OpenSSL](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl/). I found it convenient to interact with WebPKI via [Rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls).

This is part of an effort to update hyper and rust-openssl in Servo. It's important to note that I'm not changing all of the code away from OpenSSL, just the certificate verification. OpenSSL still manages the connection, which results in some conversion overhead to the appropriate types for rustls/webpki.

In order to change the verification function, you have to modify `set_verify_callback` to point to the desired function when you're creating the SSL object. Then I wrapped different parts of the verification algorithms with timing data:

## Timing Measures

### OpenSSL:
* roots-creation: (subset of http-connector-creation) this is a rustls artifact that I forgot to delete for my openssl test
* verify-hostname: time spent verifying that a certificate is valid for a domain
* http-connector-creation: total time creating the connector object
* matches-wildcard
* matches-dns: 
* openssl-verif-call: measures the total time spent in the openssl verification function
* connection:  measures how long it actually takes to connect (i.e. run `ssl.connect`)
* total-openssl-verify

### Rustls:
* rustls-verify: measures the total time spent in the rustls verification function (either `parallel_verify_server_cert` or `verify_server_cert`)
* chain-creation: measures how long it takes to convert the openssl x509 chain to the rustls certificate chain
* roots-creation: (subset of http-connector-creation) time required to create the rustls root certificate store
* http-connector-creation: total time creating the connector object
* connection: measures how long it actually takes to connect (i.e. run `ssl.connect`)
* total-rustls-verify time: measures total time performing all steps required for rustls verification

All values are averaged over the number of times a method was called while opening a site.

There are two versions of Rustls that I tested on--one does all verification steps in serial, while the other does them all in parallel. Parallel rustls still has room for improvement-- for more information, see [webpki](https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/37).

## Sites

The sites I picked for testing were the 8 featured on servo's front page, plus a few I frequently use. Most of them use TLS ECDHE RSA with AES 128 GCM SHA256 and 128 bit keys, except those noted below

* [duck duck go](https://duckduckgo.com)
* [github](https://github.com)
* [wikipedia](https://wikipedia.com)
  * TLS ECDHE ECDSA with CHACHA20 POLY1305 SHA256, 256 bit keys
* [ars technica](https://arstechnica.com/)
* [reddit](https://reddit.com)
* [rust](https://rustlang.org)
* [servo](https://servo.org)
  * TLS AES 128 GCM SHA256 TLS 1.3
* [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* [twitter](https://twitter.com)
* [cnn](https://cnn.com)
  * no encryption
* [google](https://google.co.uk)
* [washington post](https://washingtonpost.com)
* [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

# Results

I'm not sure what happened with hackernews-rustlsserial, and I'll try to get new numbers for it.

I compared results for total connection time and total verification time. For total connection time, openssl was fastest for 5/12 (excluding hackernews) sites, rustlsserial was fastest for 4, and rustlsparallel for the remaining 3. For overall verification time, openssl was fastest for 11 sites, and rustlsparallel was fastest on washingtonpost.com. 

It's interesting that openssl was almost uniformly quicker at just performing verification, but not for establishing a connection. I'm not sure why this would be. If anyone has ideas, let me know :)

Times are shown in ms.

# Next steps

1. webpki benchmarks [ECDSA](https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench/issues/25) [RSA](https://github.com/briansmith/crypto-bench/issues/24)
2. parallel signature verification [webpki](https://github.com/briansmith/webpki/issues/37)
3. Improve test set and method (this started out as an adhoc measurement, but now seems like it could yield useful data as development continues)
