# Web Compatibility and TLS
During a dev-servo discussion about the merits of various TLS libraries, the question of web compatibility came up--what cryptographic protocols does Servo need to support in order to serve most of the web?

I decided to run [cipherscan](https://github.com/mozilla/cipherscan) and get some updated results.

# Results
You can see the full results [here](http://pastebin.com/aCazxpAq), but I'll highlight what I consider the most interesting in this case.

# Discussion

I initially compiled these stats because the Servo community brought up the possibility of using [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) ([hyper crate](https://libraries.io/cargo/hyper-rustls)) in Servo. Currently, rustls only supports TLS1.2, so it seemed like a good time to get some updated cipherscan results. Over 10% of the sites surveyed only supported TLS1.1 or lower. In a production browser, this would be way too high.

Mostly, I think these numbers can be useful for prioritization right now.
